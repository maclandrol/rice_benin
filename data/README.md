## Data repository

This folder should contain the data to submit, in a well organised structure. If you are submitting data-visualization only, just let this folder empty.

The data should be computer-parsable, preferentially in a human readable format and encoded using UTF-8. To facilitate data distribution, the preferred format are `TSV`, `CSV`, `JSON`, `XML` and `YAML`, which are two of the most popular formats for data serialization.

As datasets can get quite large, you should try to archive and compress it whenever possible using format such as GZIP, LZ4 and BZIP2.

If you provide data in any other non conventional format, you should provide instructions on how it can be read in the section below.
