## Visualization repository

This folder should contain the data visualization you are submitting.  If you are submitting data only, just let this folder empty. **We only accept visualization on data that we have already indexed with an unique DOI or you are submitting alongside with the data visualization**

Visualization can be interactive or static.

### Interactive dataviz

If your are uploading an interactive dataviz, you should submit all the relevant files of your web app (html, css, js).
We ask that you provide an ```index.html``` file in which your visualization is embedded, at the root of this folder.

### Static visualisation

We only accept vector graphics (svg, eps, ps and pdf), and high quality png files (at least 150dpi). Your submission will be rejected if the image quality is too low.
