### Writing post using Jekyll

Here you can write a post about the data or dataviz you are going to submit. This is not necessary but it can be fun to analyse the dataset. Just be aware that **you own the rights and responsabilities of the content you create** and we do not endorse any statement you make. For more information, please read our [Content rights & responsibilities](https://github.com/OpenDataBenin/ContributorsGuide).

Jekyll accept mixing markdown and html. This allow you to easily link your vizualisations from the `viz` folder in your post.  Please see [blogging with Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for more information.

### Jekyll header information

Please fill the jekyll front matter (section between the triple-dashed lines) with as much information as possible. This information will be used parsed and completed with our own front matter in order to upload your submission to our registry.

- **title**: provide a title for your post
- **tags**: Provide a list of tags for your submission
- **styles**: Provide any additionnal css stylesheet that should be added.
